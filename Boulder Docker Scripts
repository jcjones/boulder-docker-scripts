These scripts help you to run Boulder + CFSSL in Docker in monolithic mode.

Easy use:

  git clone https://gist.github.com/ce9ca04e94cd9244e18a.git boulder-docker
  cd boulder-docker/
  ./boulder-docker.sh start

Note: You will need to execute `boulder-docker.sh` as a user with privileges to access Docker.

You can configure custom locations for the CFSSL storage, and Boulder's configuration, by editing the top of the `boulder-docker.sh` script.
